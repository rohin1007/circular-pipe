# Laminar Pipe Flow

Laminar flow through a circular pipe with a diameter 0.2m and length 3m at a Reynolds number of 100. 

Velocity magnitude contours, velocity profile at x=2m and velocity vectors in the developed region at the outlet are shown in the figures. The developed boundary layer can clearly be observed. The maximum velocity is around the centre of the pipe.
